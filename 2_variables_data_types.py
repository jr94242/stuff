'''
Yeah, pretty much the same thigns again, fundamental python:

data types ; variable definitions and reassigment ; data structures
if statements ; while loops ; for loops ; range/enumerate ; functions and scope

when defining a function, optional arguments are such that by default are == 0 ; make sure to add them at the end for correct 
execution

try/except blocks

functions documentation via docstrings in the beggining of the function, so that when help(func) is applied, there is proper 
documentation of the function and arguments
