# course has been finished, he now recommends not to jump directly at another course, instead:
# I should take time to do the assigment (in ipynb, visualisation is not setup here and I need to make visualisations)
# apart from doing the assigment, I need to do all the parts of the assigment ---> explanations ; markups ; conclusion ; 
# maybe blogpost
# apart from all that, I need to submit for evaluation this assigment
# after getting the assigment done, I need to fix the issue with the 1st assigment, so that I can get my certificate of completion
# after that I need to upload the code + everything done for this assigment to my portfolio as this project is a major one so far

# good luck (once all this is done, do not forget to move the code here as well, so that the course folder is complete and 
# available for future reference)
